Hello there! I'm Plaba. I'm a Computer Science Student at Bob Jones University. I'm interested in robotics, specifically path and motion planning algorithms, mathematics, and cybersecurity. This blog is a random collection of my notes from any of the above topics, as well as any other interesting things I come across.
