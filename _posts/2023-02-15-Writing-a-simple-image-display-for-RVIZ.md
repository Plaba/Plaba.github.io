Hello there! I just started actually writing my blog, so I'm going over some previous projects I worked on. This post is about a simple image display for RVIZ. I wrote this for a project I am currently developing, which is a Gazebo replacement for simple navigation simulations. I plan to write up a post about that project soon, but you're stuck with a post about RVIZ for now.
